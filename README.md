# Market-Type-Classification
# Overview
Market classification is an essential task for understanding the segmentation of products and stores. This project uses a tabular dataset to build a predictive model that classifies markets based on product and store features. The target variable ùëå
Y indicates the market type categories (e.g., 0, 1, 2). Logistic Regression is employed for its interpretability and efficiency.
